# VRV Securityâ€™s Python Intern Assignment

## Objective

The primary goal of this script is to:
1. Count the number of requests made by each IP address.
2. Identify the most frequently accessed endpoint.
3. Detect suspicious activity, such as excessive failed login attempts.

## Features

1. **Requests per IP Address**:
   - Lists the number of requests made by each IP address.
   - Sorts the results in descending order of request counts.

2. **Most Accessed Endpoint**:
   - Identifies the endpoint (URL or resource path) that was accessed the most number of times.

3. **Suspicious Activity**:
   - Flags IP addresses with suspicious behavior, such as excessive failed login attempts.
   - Uses a configurable threshold (default: 10 failed login attempts) to detect suspicious activity.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10.0 or higher
- `re` module (standard library)
- `csv` module (standard library)
- `collections` module (standard library)

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vrv-security-log-analysis.git
   cd vrv-security-log-analysis
   ```

2. **Place the Log File**:
   - Ensure the `sample.log` file is in the same directory as the script.

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python log_analysis.py
   ```

## Output

The script will display the analysis results in the terminal and save them to a CSV file named `log_analysis_results.csv`.

### Terminal Output Example

```plaintext
Requests per IP Address:
203.0.113.5          8
198.51.100.23        8
192.168.1.1          7
10.0.0.2             6
192.168.1.100        5

Most Frequently Accessed Endpoint:
/login (Accessed 13 times)

Suspicious Activity Detected:
No suspicious activity detected.
```

### CSV File Structure

The CSV file will have the following structure:

```plaintext
Count Requests per IP Address:
IP Address,Request Count
203.0.113.5,8
198.51.100.23,8
192.168.1.1,7
10.0.0.2,6
192.168.1.100,5

Most Accessed Frequently Endpoint:
Endpoint,Access Count
/login,13

Suspicious Activity:
IP Address,Failed Login Attempts
```

## Sample Log File

A sample log file named `sample.log` is provided for testing the script. The log file contains entries similar to the following:

```plaintext
192.168.1.1 - - [03/Dec/2024:10:12:34 +0000] "GET /home HTTP/1.1" 200 512
203.0.113.5 - - [03/Dec/2024:10:12:35 +0000] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 401 128 "Invalid credentials"
10.0.0.2 - - [03/Dec/2024:10:12:36 +0000] "GET /about HTTP/1.1" 200 256
...
```
